Appointment Module Shanta lifestyle will collaborate and bring their products from different parts of the world from renowned brands. The process of delivering and showcasing the products at their showroom has a dependency on the shipment time which is due to logistical reasons. We introduced an appointment module to overcome this situation. The flow of the module is defined in a way that customers can order their desired items at all times with the help of scheduling an appointment. In terms of development, we implemented various parameters depending on the user and the products. Schedule management is also done carefully, and the complexity is taken into consideration on the code level rather than the user level.

They specialize in children-based fun programs and shows, aiming to enhance young viewers' creativity through innovative means. To add a fun element to their list of programs, Duronto Television decided to host a quiz show, formatted in a number of rounds and stages, with children and their family members as the participants. In order to direct the show simultaneously between the program director, presenter, and participants, an exclusive user-based application was required to manage the process efficiently. Dcastalia’s proven track record in the software development industry, in app design and development, proved to be the answer to Duronto Television's dilemma. Duronto Television engaged Dcastalia to develop an application for them that would help run and shoot the show effortlessly. Our accomplishment in creating an app as per the client’s requirement delighted Duronto Television and enabled them to go live with various Quiz shows over the last couple of years, such as “BBC Mastermind Family in Bangladesh,” “Janar Ache Onek Kichu,” etc. scope of work Android App Development Web App DevelopmentCMS DevelopmentUX Design Duronto Television Quiz App is a multilayered application. Starting with a good UX solution based on research and brainstorming, we portrayed the overflow of the data and infographics of how the user will use it. Our skilled developers dictated these flows into live working apps, integrating all essential logic and parameters for each module. Technology The project has three separate user-based platforms linked together. So, all the apps must be synchronized to ensure smooth functioning without any issues. To achieve our objective we implemented cutting-edge technologies with innovative techniques such as the latest PHP frameworks, Socket IO, customized API, and tracing network IPs. Core Features Real-Time Synchronization The app has three different users with their exclusive apps: Director App, Presenter App, and Participant App. Each of these apps is connected, where the Director controls the whole system, generates quiz questions, and maintains the answers and scores. The presenter only views the updates pushed by the director while the participants view and answer the questions. We architected the technique to ensure seamless and fast communication among the apps. Moreover, we used Socket IO to provide low-latency, bidirectional, and event-based communication between the client-side and the server-side, thereby, creating an ideal solution.

Interactive Theme Setup A key requirement by the client was to use a single system for multiple programs, shows, and game stages, and modify the themes of the apps as needed, using the same platform. The client wanted the luxury to change and customize the whole outlook of the user interface dynamically, including the background, design of the buttons, and question patterns. We designed and developed a robust theme customization module in a powerful CMS to provide a multi-usable system and cater to the user's needs. The theme can be changed dynamically to give the user a different look and experience, as required.

A Buzzer is an amazing option that is required for certain game types. In a game among multiple players, the participants get the question and are required to press the buzzer on their screen as fast as possible to get the first chance to answer. Given the purpose of the buzzer, the system must be able to register the clicks and communicate with the director app with minimal time delay. The calculation of time difference is kept at microseconds for an optimal experience achieved with cutting-edge technology. The buzzer is also linked with a sound generator to alert the users within instants.

Given the purpose of the buzzer, the system must be able to register the clicks and communicate with the director app with minimal time delay. The calculation of time difference is kept at microseconds for an optimal experience achieved with cutting-edge technology. The buzzer is also linked with a sound generator to alert the users within instants. Multi-App Bridging with Offline Integration The apps function on their own but are centrally controlled by a well-designed and powerful CMS. The apps are also designed and developed to synchronize with each other within microseconds. We also implemented the apps to be run offline with the help of a local server that is easy to set. The result was reduced dependencies on the internet, allowing our client the privilege of portability of the system.

Challenges & Our Approach Multi Apps Synchronization It was a challenge to meet the requirement of connecting the three applications on one platform, Director Application, Presenter Application, and Participant Application to facilitate synchronized communication between them. Our Approach We approached the issue by rechecking the ideas with our pool of resources and determining a concrete effective solution. We implemented the Node server setup and used Socket IO for faster and more reliable synchronization and communication. The socket IO is applied on both the server and client end, which helped us overcome this challenge by the most efficient means. Buzzer Integration As unique as the idea of using a buzzer is, it was a complex challenge to use a third-party device to integrate the buzzer and connect it with our system. Our Approach Integrating the buzzer required us to use a third-party device known as SNOFF wifi smart switch. We determined the fu",

Having said that, to get the optimum benefit of your website, you must keep it up-to-date to ensure it is running smoothly by generating leads and expanding reach 24/7!Website maintenance and keeping it up-to-date are important once your website is up and running. However, it is common practice in Bangladesh that business owners give their full effort into building their websites to get an appealing digital presence and connect with their customers, then they neglect the fact that their sites also need maintenance support to function properly.To solve this problem, business operators need to be familiar with the life-changing tips of website maintenance services in Bangladesh so that they can focus on both their core services and website maintenance simultaneously. 1 Checklist The Meaning and Importance of Website Maintenance Do you regularly monitor your car for leaks or damages? Or do you check the tire pressure or fuel level regularly before using? I bet the answer is YES!Thus, website maintenance is like owning a car, which means you have to optimize page speed, check security (Owasp top 10), solve CMS bugs, prepare analytics reports, record codebase backup and database backup, maintain SEO snippets, monitor uptime, technical consultation, and update content on a regular basis.However, what happens if you do not maintain your car regularly or ignore checking and preparing the car before using it? Well, the consequences could be terrible. The long-term cost of not maintaining your car can contain hefty repair bills for awful brakes, failed emissions tests, or even a failed engine.Likewise, if you avoid maintaining your website, there are the most obvious risks of getting hacked or damaging the integrity issues of the website. It will not only affect your cybersecurity but also sabotage your customer’s trust by attacking their private information. Therefore, the importance of maintenance services is significant for every website. 2 What is Included in the Maintenance Packages? The website maintenance package involves checking security updates, encouraging traffic growth, and ensuring Google is pleased with the site’s performance. So, it includes:Security UpdatesGoogle analytics integrationWebsite speed optimizationCrawling and indexing issuesRepair broken links and HTML errorsSSL InstallationGoogle Search Console SetupDrupal/Magento/WordPress UpdateCodebase BackupDatabase BackupKeep plugins up to dateDelete unnecessary plugins and themesClear junk filesWebsite Responsive OptimizationSort any malicious data issueMonthly analytics reportTechnical consultationSocial media post designSEO snippetContent updateTo get the best result, a fixed website maintenance service is necessary, and a consistent plan goes beyond merely assuring the site is up and running regularly. If you are aware of the modern website trends, you already know these trends are ever-changing.In such circumstances, a professional support team who has been working in the market for over a long time can help the business planners to have a secured and upgraded digital presence with experienced and fundamental knowledge about the web.As digital transformation is an increasing trend all over the globe and modern technology has now become an inseparable part of modern businesses, great technologies may cause great complexities. In such cases, website maintenance services play a great role by providing technical consultation to offer 360-degree solutions to the website owners. 3 Useful Tips to Maintain a Website? A report published by the Society of Digital Agencies (SoDA) stated that 77% of agencies believe a bad website user experience is a weakness for their clients. Therefore, to provide a healthy and secure website to the customers, continuous monitoring and updating the website are the keys. However, how often should you update your website? Well, the answer is it depends on the nature of the task that you carry out. To make your work easier, there is a category of website maintenance services listed below based on how often you should perform them.Annual tasksRenewing website domain name.Upgrading website design.Reviewing content on each page to check its up-to-date.Quarterly tasksSearching for scopes to the overall website improvement.Updating web graphics and contents to make them up-to-date.Refreshing meta descriptions and meta titles.Checking mobile responsiveness.Fixing issues with update popups, forms, and CTAConfirming that marketing campaigns are all good.Restoring the latest backup.Monthly tasksMonitoring website loading speed.Analyzing security scans.Checking website statistics.Keeping track of local search visibility.Weekly tasksSearching for 404 errors on the website.Updating core plugins and website software.Posting SEO-friendly blog posts.Checking for any broken links. 4 Why do you Need Website Maintenance? “88% of online consumers are less likely to return to a site after a bad experience”While users land on your website, they never expect to wait a long time to load the web pages or to find any issues with links, contact forms, contents, payment mechanisms, shopping carts, etc. While waiting, if they feel that your website is not offering value up to the market trend, they might move towards other competitors in the market. Apart from retaining customers, there are countless reasons for investing in website maintenance and some of them are listed below:Enhances SecurityEvery website owner’s first and major concern is security, and therefore, there is no setback from having a robust website maintenance service. According to PURPLESEC, 87% of websites have high or medium cyber security risks. If you run your website on WordPress or other Content Management systems (CMS), make sure that you are using the latest version with the newest security plugins. Otherwise, it may get malware and DDoS attack, which is harmful not only to you but also to all the users who have visited your site.More than 50,000 websites get hacked every day, which is significantly alarming for website security. Besides, if a website is hacked it can lose about 98% of traffic.Therefore, maintenance service packages include providing security features and modules to preserve website damages, including loss of reputation, finance, and intellectual properties, and even getting lawsuits for breaching users’ privacy.Boosts SEO and Website TrafficTo rank your website on the first page of the search engine, you need to present the most recent content with the latest graphics on your website. This is because search engines like Google, elevate rankings for sites that are updated routinely. Accordingly, a higher ranking means higher visibility, which eventually leads to more traffic on your website.93% of online experiences begin with a search engine. Source: FORBESA strategic SEO plan offers a higher search engine ranking, increased visibility, and a higher chance of conversion rate. In this process, regular updating of the website through a consistent maintenance plan boosts SEO performance.Website Performance OptimizationYour website is the foundation of your business on the internet, hence, a functional website is crucial to business success. When users visit your website and find that loading time is more than three seconds, or contents do not appear properly, their trust in your company would be jeopardized. Therefore, before it happens to your digital platform, it is time to optimize your website performance.User Experience OptimizationRemoving outdated content and including actionable sections on your website helps you to provide an idea to the users about what you are up to and what currently makes you different in the market. Also, regular sharing content, including upcoming events, image galleries, and blogs on the websites, eventually promotes your business and mission. Again, your",

      "content": "Project Overview Role Management System Development Client S-Tech Bangladesh Completed On 2019 The Project Aarong is a Bangladeshi store brand that specializes in ethnic apparel and handicrafts. It is owned by a non-profit development organization, called Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee (BRAC). Aarong is Bangladesh's most successful lifestyle retail chain, selling ethical products since 1978. It was founded as a simple way to help rural craftspeople climb beyond poverty. It presently has twenty-one locations nationwide. Dcastalia, a top software development company in Bangladesh, partnered with S-tech Limited to develop a robust management system for Aarong. The objective of the project was to increase the productivity and efficiency of the management team. This queue management system was developed for in-house meeting management and report generation purposes. Aarong’s designers meet with interested vendors around the country, who are skilled at knitting traditional apparel and creating decorative pottery that can cater to the taste of Aarong customers, through trendsetting lifestyle products. The queue management system was designed to ensure organized documentation and coordination of vendor meetings. scope of work Software DevelopmentSystem ArchitectureMaintenance Dcastalia is known for its creativity, technical expertise, and attention to detail. Our objective was to tailor a management system that would provide Aarong with the optimum level of utility in terms of use and would match their requirements perfectly. Aarong required a fast and smooth operating system to manage their daily operations. In building the system, we had to ensure the system was user-friendly with attractive features. To plan the project, our first step was to conduct thorough research and analysis on the usability of the management system and then strategize an aesthetic UI/UX design and development.

Core Features Kiosk Machine Kiosk machines are automated booths that elevate operational efficiency and customer experience. It is one of the most unique and crucial features in the system to manage the vendors efficiently. The development for the kiosk machine was customized as per the client's requirement and was designed to be easily used by everyone. Vendors are required to input their phone numbers on the screen and the system calculates the waiting time and provides a printed token with a serial number. An OTP is also sent to the vendor’s phone to confirm their serial number. Kiosk Machine Kiosk machines are automated booths that elevate operational efficiency and customer experience.

Uniquely Designed Interface As a top software development company in Bangladesh, Dcastalia is reputed to match a system’s design and development with the client’s requirements as closely as possible. For the Aarong queue management system, it was essential to build an attractive and easy-to-understand user interface, and the customizations were done as per the client’s preferences. The system was thus designed with functionality and ease of navigation being the top priority to meet the client’s objectives. Moreover, a well defined user-interface was an essential feature to represent the culture and theme of Aarong as a top notch ethnic lifestyle brand in Bangladesh.

Tab Management A connecting tab was developed for the system to allow the designers to ensure the vendor's serial number on the tokens. Through this process, the management is able to validate the meeting time between the designers and the vendors and confirm the attendance of both parties. The tab was allocated to the designers for verification and record management. So, when the vendors attend the meeting, designers verify their serial number by scanning the token in the tab. Therefore, once the meeting started, a timer would initiate, logging the meeting time in the system along with the vendor’s information.

Admin Panel An admin panel was developed to manage the meeting process with the vendors and designers. The admin panel is an essential feature of Aarong’s queue management system. The admin has access to the vendor's and designers' details and meeting agenda. When a designer is unavailable for a scheduled meeting, they have the authority to easily forward the vendors to available designers and conduct the meeting. Moreover, they have access to the complete overview of the team and meeting reports as well. Admin Panel An admin panel was developed to manage the meeting process with the vendors and designers.

The report shows the details of average meeting hours, the numbers of canceled meetings, and the vendors that were transferred to other designers. Moreover, the system generates a performance report of the designers as well.

      "description": "In this era of digitalization, the web is expanding with an ever-increasing number of websites. Indeed, there are more than 1 billion websites on the world",
      "content": "In this era of digitalization, the web is expanding with an ever-increasing number of websites. Indeed, there are more than 1 billion websites on the world wide web, and the number keeps growing every second. Thus, this has become a common desire of every people both in Bangladesh and worldwide that the website they are establishing must be unique and distinguishable to stand in the competition by adding as much customization as possible. Amazingly, WordPress (WP) development offers the opportunity to tailor a website based on preferences that best suit the website's purpose. This is one of the many reasons why WordPress (WP) has become widely popular in every website development company in Bangladesh.Aside from WordPress (WP), there are other site-building packages like Joomla and Drupal, which are extensively used and available for free download and customization. However, WordPress (WP) exceeds all other content management systems based on several factors, which will be discussed below. Moreover, unlike other management systems, WordPress (WP) has super accessible features for beginners that require no high-level expertise of coding or programming and makes it trendy among all types of users. Checklist WordPress, the King of CMS In 2003, WordPress (WP) was first introduced as an open-source platform, which currently powers more than 40% of websites on the internet. Within the span of around twenty years, WordPress has become the most preferred platform for website development for numerous advantages. According to W3Tech, WordPress (WP) controls around 61.8% of the CMS market share. Popular websites around the globe, the White House, BBC America, Coca-cola, the Wall Street Journal, and many more are developed employing the WordPress (WP) content management system.Alongside, there are infinite reasons why and how WordPress is playing the dominant role like a king in the CMS market. Some of them are listed below: 1 A Wide Range of Google Search The popularity of WordPress can be assumed by looking at the number of google searches containing the keyword ‘WordPress’, which is near to 450,000. If we count it by considering the global search, there are over 2.9 million search results. Well, I believe these figures are enough to prove that WordPress is widely in vogue. 2 Considerable Number of Downloads WordPress 5.9 version was introduced in January 2022, which has already gained fame among web development companies in Bangladesh as well as abroad. The number of downloads for this version exceeds 20 million, which keeps increasing every second. This significant volume of WP downloads indicates its demand among developers. You can also check the real-time data from the download counter and observe how fast the number increases.Likewise, the number of downloads for WordPress plug-ins is well sufficient to prove its notable demand. For example, here are a few statistics collected from WordPress’s official site.More than 82 million total downloads make Akismet the most commonly used plugin of all time.The next position goes to Jetpack, with exceeding approximately 53 million downloadsEleven plugins have attained around 7+ million downloads, and these are” WooCommerce, NextGEN Gallery, WordPress Importer, WP Super Cache, Google Analytics by Yoast, Google XML Sitemaps, Jetpack, Contact Form 7, Yoast SEO, All in One SEO Pack, Wordfence Security.Nineteen plug-ins named Hello Dolly, W3 Total Cache, Contact Form 7, Really Simple CAPTCHA, All in One SEO Pack, Google Analytics by Yoast, Google XML Sitemaps, WordPress Importer, Regenerate Thumbnails, WooCommerce, WP-PageNavi, WP Super Cache, Jetpack, TinyMCE Advanced, NextGEN Gallery, Wordfence Security, Yoast SEO, Advanced Custom Fields, Akismet have got more than 1+ million active installs mark. 3 Continuous Activities​ Considering the popularity of WordPress, the leading content management system, the activities of WP sites are surprisingly rich. According to the official WordPress website, users around the globe make 27 posts every second, which creates 1,620 posts every minute, 97,222 posts every hour, and 2,333,333 new posts every single day. Eventually, WP sites generate approximately 70 million new posts and 77 million new comments each month, which is the highest in the market. 4 Overwhelming Number of Page Visits​ As it is one of the most active platforms, WP gets the most visitors each month which is nearly 156 million, as reported by Automatic. It is also stated that the page reach of the WordPress network has hit 22 billion, which is almost equivalent to the world’s total population.The above-discussed factors are well enough to prove why WordPress is still controlling the place of the king in the market. There are also plenty of advantages that make WordPress development conventional and preferable in every WordPress development company in Bangladesh. Why is WordPress the Ideal Choice of Every Website Development Company in Bangladesh? For the last couple of years, especially during the outbreak of Covid-19, Bangladesh has been facing a drastic rise in creating the web identity of businesses. The reason is everything is being online, particularly while the pandemic locked everyone inside the home. Accordingly, developers are facing a boom in website development. With this increasing demand, every web development company in Bangladesh prefers a user-friendly, cost-effective, and easily accessible platform to build websites. Therefore, WordPress is their ideal choice as it offers multiple opportunities in website development. Some of its benefits are discussed below: Open Source Software Since the outset of WordPress, it has always been free for users. You can easily download your personal copy just by visiting the official website, wordpress.org, and clicking the ‘Get WordPress’ button. However, in case you do not have the idea or time to install, run, and host your website, you might need help from experts. Flexible and Adaptable WordPress has a multitude of uses for different websites ranging from complex multinationals to small businesses, even for personal blogs. You can also utilize WordPress for full-service e-commerce business, portfolios, or even for hosting a social network, group, or podcast. Thus, WordPress is suitable to develop a functional website and fulfill multiple needs of that particular website with its core packages supported by basic or premium plug-ins. User-FriendlyBy using open-source software you get the ability to modify and enhance every aspect of the marketplace architecture, logic, and appearance. However, such freedom comes at the cost of a lengthier and pricier development process, so if a paid ready-made solution satisfies your business goals it can be an optimal choice. Extensive series of themes and plug-ins Currently, the WordPress theme directory has 9,246 free themes. Source: WordPress Theme Dictionary The biggest benefit of getting thousands of free themes on WordPress is that the apprentices, who like to experiment before implementing the final one, can comfortably do so without worrying about costs. However, in this era of worldwide development, it is significant to add something unique to your own website to stand out in the competition. Therefore, whenever you feel restricted with basic free themes that are used by multiple websites at the very same time, you can solve this problem by utilizing numerous plugins that WordPress offers to extend the functionality of websites. There are currently 59,450 free plug-ins of WordPress. Source: Plugin Dictionary WordPress has the power of adaptability based on users’ requirements with its thousand of existing plug-ins which developers can utilize whenever they face any problem, no matter how diverse the issue is. Besides, it has become easier to add multifarious features from such extended categories of plug-ins. Though WordPress has basic features to develop a website, some users require more specialized functions and ",

      "content": "Project Overview Role System Development Client Spectra Group Completed On 2020 The Project Spectra Group is one of the leading groups of industries in Bangladesh. Their experience in constructing architectural heights clearly establishes their skills and grasp of the industry. The increase in the demand for construction development in Bangladesh and the growing size of the company made it difficult for the organization to maintain information records. It was essential for the company to build a construction management system that could be easily accessible by all in-house employees for smooth operation To accomplish this task, Spectra Group required a seasoned software company in Bangladesh and thus, approached Dcastalia, to build them an efficient management system as per their requirements. To summarize, the system would be capable of providing time and price estimations and quotations for different projects based on the data inputs and would track the project progress and status at any given time and generate reports for analysis. scope of work Software Development UI/UX DesignTechnical SupportApplication Training The client wanted a simple and customized navigational system for their in-house team. Therefore, developing a technically feasible and optimal system for Spectra Group was our priority as a top software company in Bangladesh. We customized the system based on our UX/UI perspective aligning with their requirement and provided a fantastic modern technical support framework to ensure the functionality and usability of the project. Technologies Dcastalia used cutting edge modern technologies to develop and validate a technically enhanced ‘Construction Management Information System’. The software application was required for Spectra Group’s in-house team, therefore a thoroughly customized system with optimum features was designed for the client, as is expected of a reliable software company. Core Features Role Specified Module Each member who logs into the system would have different roles according to the tasks assigned for the project. So, a unique user-specific view is generated for the members. Moreover, a data representative, precisely an engineer, would be able to create a sheet of items required to complete the project. It is also possible to estimate the number of materials and equipment required in a specific project as well as the manpower needed for the construction. Furthermore, a price quotation depending on the estimation is given. This would allow the project’s team leads to generate a progress report that reflects the status of the project.

Furthermore, a price quotation depending on the estimation is given. This would allow the project’s team leads to generate a progress report that reflects the status of the project. Estimation And Quotation Report The system's core purpose is to generate reports and make sure everyone is aligned with the project’s progress, quotation, estimation, and further details. The report helps the team to provide a clear idea about the project with the estimated analysis reports. Moreover, it allows the team members to make updates to the data as and when required such as the material's increment in price over time.

Moreover, it allows the team members to make updates to the data as and when required such as the material's increment in price over time. Material And Equipment Module Another essential feature of the system is that it maintains inventory records. The generated reports allow the engineers to allocate unused materials or equipment hours to another project if they are left unused due to a project pause or other delays. The material management module makes an estimated breakdown of the raw, and work-in-process material. It thus determines which equipment has remaining hours, to be further allocated to the projects. This whole process ultimately increases work efficiency. Material And Equipment Module Another essential feature of the system is that it maintains inventory records.

As such, the system design prioritized the projects’ ability to generate project-wise progress reports over time. This feature is also crucial to synchronize the project progress, at any time, and any current or foreseeable issues that may arise, over the life of a project. It provides a transparent picture and maintains a clear flow of communication, across the hierarchy of the company, from the company director to the assigned project team, for all projects.

Challenges & Our Approach Data Handling Spectra Group consists of an immense collection of databases. Therefore, representing the data in the system became an obstacle for our team and created a blocker when entered into the system for estimation purposes. As a reputable software development company, it was our responsibility to ensure that this issue was effectively resolved with optimum results. Our Approach We implemented different formats of excel and algorithms to execute calculation methods to import tender information and provide project estimation. This resulted in resolving the data presentation and importing estimation issues without causing any usability or functional problems. Managing Analysis Report Generating the analysis report for the project’s estimation, quotation, and progress proved to be a tedious task, as it required multiple stages of approval from engineers, to confirm the validity of the reports. Furthermore, the calculations based on the data inputs and updates for the initial and final reports came with various complexities and became an obstacle to importing correct information from the system. Our Approach We implemented the usage of complex and custom calculation methods that allowed the report to be calculated in a precise process. Furthermore, the system was designed to acquire the authorization of the user to ensure the validity of the data, before it was allowed to generate reports. Equipment Management A key aspect of the system required managing the equipment and calculating the depreciation value of machinery, and equipment, over tim",

      "content": "The favorite plants of yours that are hanging on your balcony don’t bloom or look fresh without any effort. They need continuous care, nurturing, and maintenance. To water your plants regularly is not just a suggestion, it is a requirement you need to follow in order to keep them alive. Likewise, a WordPress website maintenance plan is like watering your plants. It is critical for your business that your website remains functioning and performs well.If you are thinking that a WordPress website just needs a hosting service after it is done being developed then you are wrong because it is not a one-time thing. WordPress website needs continuous maintenance in order to perform effectively and help your business to grow.There are hundreds of plans roaming around the internet telling you about a regular WordPress website maintenance strategy. But first, let me show you 10 significant reasons behind you need a WordPress maintenance plan. 1 Checklist Security to avoid being hacked Security is perhaps the major reason why you should keep your WordPress website up to date, above all other benefits. According to indusface, Every 39 seconds, a website is targeted, and attackers steal 75 records each second. This means your website is always on the verge of being hacked and you can lose your valuable data and critical information and which will hamper your business severely. According to Hosting Tribunal, WordPress currently powers 39.6% of all online websites in the world. And because of its popularity, WordPress websites always stay on top of hackers’ targets. As it is open-source, there is a possibility that hackers might study the source code and discover new ways to sneak into websites. Therefore, If your WordPress website is not kept up to date with the newest security updates, it becomes more insecure by the day. 2 Maximum Performance Benefits In this fast-paced world, everyone has become used to the fastest internet, for example, if you search “WordPress”, google will show you About 2,640,000,000 results within 0.51 seconds which is a lot of results in a very little time. If your website’s loading page becomes slow then it will surely affect your online presence negatively. According to BackLinko, a web page’s average page loading time is 10.3 seconds on desktop and 27.3 seconds on mobile.WordPress website needs many plug-ins and among them, if a single plug-in is missing an update then this can slow down your website. Developers should maintain regular updates to ensure compatibility. If you run your WordPress website maintenance regularly, you can easily ensure the fastest speed on your site which will maximize the website’s performance and help you to gain more traffic. 3 Create a Backup of your WordPress Website You may have installed security measures to protect your website, yet your website data may still be compromised. The possibility of hackers obtaining corporate data or an innocent coding error putting your site down will always exist.As a result, it is critical that your WordPress maintenance plan includes regular off-site backups. The term “off-site” refers to backing up your website on a second server, giving you two backup sources.f something were to happen to your website, you will be glad you invested in regular off-site backups and do not lose useful data. 4 Enhance your User Experience Without proper maintenance, your WordPress website may contain bugs that will lead to a poor user experience due to website errors such as broken forms, slow loading speed, images that disappear, and so on.Nobody loves a site that looks confused and broken or is out of date, and it might frustrate the visitors. Updating your WordPress website regularly and including a “bug repair” system can find out all little bugs and repair them to enhance the user experience for your website. You should always prioritize user experience as it plays a crucial role in your web development and maintenance service. 5 Keep Up with the New Technology Every day, the technology that interfaces with your WordPress website evolve. Aside from adopting frequent software updates to keep software versions as current as possible, it is also critical to keep an eye on the market for newer and better software in general.Eventually, a particular piece of technology may become outdated and no longer be as effective as it was before.With WordPress support and maintenance services, you can ensure that your website is always running to the highest industry standards by regularly updating WordPress themes, plug-ins, and versions. 6 Site Health Monitoring Crawlers for search engines filter through web pages in the backend and index them for visitors. Working links, backups, and optimizations are all signs of a healthy website. Incorrect backlinks, 404 error pages, and slow-loading pages can harm your website’s reputation. Regular health inspections by experienced personnel guarantee that adequate storage space is used, site speed is adequate, and technical defects are resolved as soon as they appear. 7 Time and Cost Savings As we discussed before if you don’t maintain your WordPress website, it may cause your website many dysfunctions like data loss, slowing down the website, bad user experience, and many more which will eventually impact your business badly, and repairing these errors will cost a lot of money and time. And it is a well-known fact that Prevention is better than cure. So if you can prevent this kind of dysfunction then it will be beneficial to your business in terms of money and time.Managing all parts of WordPress websites can be difficult, and self-management of company websites is frequently injurious to business success. Experts are familiar with intricate programs, algorithms, and plugins, which aids in better resource management. Professional WordPress maintenance plans and solutions allow you to concentrate on crucial business choices and the development of your core business which is a much more cost-effective way without any hassle. 8 Better Revenue Generation A well-functioning website with appealing content has a low bounce rate, which means more consumers for a longer period of time. Increased site rankings provide the added benefit of attracting more high-quality visitors who readily convert into leads.So without any doubt, it helps to generate great revenue and eventually more businesses for your company. 9 Search Engine Ranking Websites with outdated material are ranked lower in search engine results. Some search engines, such as Google, use the “if-modified-since” HTTP header to decide whether your website is worth crawling. Failure to make frequent changes may cause you to be moved below current competitors in the listings, costing you business in the long run. That’s why SEO services should be maintained regularly. 10 Improving Brand Reputation Your website is mainly the first impression and your first opportunity to persuade your users to become paying customers. If your website fails to wow them, and especially if it annoys them, you have a significantly lower chance of gaining their business, which will eventually hamper your brand image. A slow website or website with many errors and bugs is not good for improving your brand identity. By having a WordPress maintenance service, you can easily avoid these kinds of negative perceptions of your brand. Regular maintenance will make your website fast, bug-free, and reliable which will eventually boost your brand reputation. What is typically included in a WordPress Maintenance Service? WordPress Maintenance Services can be performed on a weekly or monthly basis. The service often uses the following action –Server management Off-site backups on a regular basisPlugin, theme, and core upgrades Uptime monitoring Security monitoring Bug fixesPage loading speed optimization Ongoing website work, training, and support Let’s see some steps to follow for a healthy WordPress Website Regularly backup your websiteUpda",
