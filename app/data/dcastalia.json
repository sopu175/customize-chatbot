They specialize in children-based fun programs and shows, aiming to enhance young viewers' creativity through innovative means. To add a fun element to their list of programs, Duronto Television decided to host a quiz show, formatted in a number of rounds and stages, with children and their family members as the participants. In order to direct the show simultaneously between the program director, presenter, and participants, an exclusive user-based application was required to manage the process efficiently. Dcastalia’s proven track record in the software development industry, in app design and development, proved to be the answer to Duronto Television's dilemma. Duronto Television engaged Dcastalia to develop an application for them that would help run and shoot the show effortlessly. Our accomplishment in creating an app as per the client’s requirement delighted Duronto Television and enabled them to go live with various Quiz shows over the last couple of years, such as “BBC Mastermind Family in Bangladesh,” “Janar Ache Onek Kichu,” etc. Read More scope of work Android App Development Web App DevelopmentCMS DevelopmentUX Design Duronto Television Quiz App is a multilayered application. Starting with a good UX solution based on research and brainstorming, we portrayed the overflow of the data and infographics of how the user will use it. Our skilled developers dictated these flows into live working apps, integrating all essential logic and parameters for each module. Technology The project has three separate user-based platforms linked together. So, all the apps must be synchronized to ensure smooth functioning without any issues. To achieve our objective we implemented cutting-edge technologies with innovative techniques such as the latest PHP frameworks, Socket IO, customized API, and tracing network IPs. Core Features Real-Time Synchronization The app has three different users with their exclusive apps: Director App, Presenter App, and Participant App. Each of these apps is connected, where the Director controls the whole system, generates quiz questions, and maintains the answers and scores. The presenter only views the updates pushed by the director while the participants view and answer the questions. We architected the technique to ensure seamless and fast communication among the apps. Moreover, we used Socket IO to provide low-latency, bidirectional, and event-based communication between the client-side and the server-side, thereby, creating an ideal solution.

Interactive Theme Setup A key requirement by the client was to use a single system for multiple programs, shows, and game stages, and modify the themes of the apps as needed, using the same platform. The client wanted the luxury to change and customize the whole outlook of the user interface dynamically, including the background, design of the buttons, and question patterns. We designed and developed a robust theme customization module in a powerful CMS to provide a multi-usable system and cater to the user's needs. The theme can be changed dynamically to give the user a different look and experience, as required.

      "description": "In this era of digitalization, the web is expanding with an ever-increasing number of websites. Indeed, there are more than 1 billion websites on the world",
      "content": "In this era of digitalization, the web is expanding with an ever-increasing number of websites. Indeed, there are more than 1 billion websites on the world wide web, and the number keeps growing every second. Thus, this has become a common desire of every people both in Bangladesh and worldwide that the website they are establishing must be unique and distinguishable to stand in the competition by adding as much customization as possible. Amazingly, WordPress (WP) development offers the opportunity to tailor a website based on preferences that best suit the website's purpose. This is one of the many reasons why WordPress (WP) has become widely popular in every website development company in Bangladesh.Aside from WordPress (WP), there are other site-building packages like Joomla and Drupal, which are extensively used and available for free download and customization. However, WordPress (WP) exceeds all other content management systems based on several factors, which will be discussed below. Moreover, unlike other management systems, WordPress (WP) has super accessible features for beginners that require no high-level expertise of coding or programming and makes it trendy among all types of users. Checklist WordPress, the King of CMS In 2003, WordPress (WP) was first introduced as an open-source platform, which currently powers more than 40% of websites on the internet. Within the span of around twenty years, WordPress has become the most preferred platform for website development for numerous advantages. According to W3Tech, WordPress (WP) controls around 61.8% of the CMS market share. Popular websites around the globe, the White House, BBC America, Coca-cola, the Wall Street Journal, and many more are developed employing the WordPress (WP) content management system. Alongside, there are infinite reasons why and how WordPress is playing the dominant role like a king in the CMS market. Some of them are listed below: 1 A Wide Range of Google Search The popularity of WordPress can be assumed by looking at the number of google searches containing the keyword ‘WordPress’, which is near to 450,000. If we count it by considering the global search, there are over 2.9 million search results. Well, I believe these figures are enough to prove that WordPress is widely in vogue. 2 Considerable Number of Downloads WordPress 5.9 version was introduced in January 2022, which has already gained fame among web development companies in Bangladesh as well as abroad. The number of downloads for this version exceeds 20 million, which keeps increasing every second. This significant volume of WP downloads indicates its demand among developers. You can also check the real-time data from the download counter and observe how fast the number increases.Likewise, the number of downloads for WordPress plug-ins is well sufficient to prove its notable demand. For example, here are a few statistics collected from WordPress’s official site. More than 82 million total downloads make Akismet the most commonly used plugin of all time.The next position goes to Jetpack, with exceeding approximately 53 million downloadsEleven plugins have attained around 7+ million downloads, and these are” WooCommerce, NextGEN Gallery, WordPress Importer, WP Super Cache, Google Analytics by Yoast, Google XML Sitemaps, Jetpack, Contact Form 7, Yoast SEO, All in One SEO Pack, Wordfence Security.Nineteen plug-ins named Hello Dolly, W3 Total Cache, Contact Form 7, Really Simple CAPTCHA, All in One SEO Pack, Google Analytics by Yoast, Google XML Sitemaps, WordPress Importer, Regenerate Thumbnails, WooCommerce, WP-PageNavi, WP Super Cache, Jetpack, TinyMCE Advanced, NextGEN Gallery, Wordfence Security, Yoast SEO, Advanced Custom Fields, Akismet have got more than 1+ million active installs mark. 3 Continuous Activities​ Considering the popularity of WordPress, the leading content management system, the activities of WP sites are surprisingly rich. According to the official WordPress website, users around the globe make 27 posts every second, which creates 1,620 posts every minute, 97,222 posts every hour, and 2,333,333 new posts every single day. Eventually, WP sites generate approximately 70 million new posts and 77 million new comments each month, which is the highest in the market. 4 Overwhelming Number of Page Visits​ As it is one of the most active platforms, WP gets the most visitors each month which is nearly 156 million, as reported by Automatic. It is also stated that the page reach of the WordPress network has hit 22 billion, which is almost equivalent to the world’s total population.The above-discussed factors are well enough to prove why WordPress is still controlling the place of the king in the market. There are also plenty of advantages that make WordPress development conventional and preferable in every WordPress development company in Bangladesh. Why is WordPress the Ideal Choice of Every Website Development Company in Bangladesh? For the last couple of",

In this stage, we find the keyword phrases that will be used for optimization. When conducting keyword research we try to find the balance between two major factors which are, high keyword usage by people and comparatively low utilization in search engines by competitors. Understanding the starting position of the client site and Goal setting After we are done establishing the targeted keyword phrases of the client's site and starting position relative to the site’s competitive set, we then try to understand the starting position of the client site is in the search engine. When we have this information, we can then see which areas require optimization and it also provides us with a baseline against which to gauge the subsequent campaign’s success. Another aspect that we focus on is the traffic of the client site. This gives us the information on how many visitors are visiting the client's site, how are the visitors finding the site, what keywords are they using, bounce rate, etc. all this information helps us in making further marketing decisions. Implementing Content Strategy High-quality content and link building are the two most important signals used by Google to rank your website for search. When a site loads with high-quality content, it gives the visitor a reason to stay and also gives them a reason to revisit if the contents are really engaging.

      "content": "The favorite plants of yours that are hanging on your balcony don’t bloom or look fresh without any effort. They need continuous care, nurturing, and maintenance. To water your plants regularly is not just a suggestion, it is a requirement you need to follow in order to keep them alive. Likewise, a WordPress website maintenance plan is like watering your plants. It is critical for your business that your website remains functioning and performs well.If you are thinking that a WordPress website just needs a hosting service after it is done being developed then you are wrong because it is not a one-time thing. WordPress website needs continuous maintenance in order to perform effectively and help your business to grow.There are hundreds of plans roaming around the internet telling you about a regular WordPress website maintenance strategy. But first, let me show you 10 significant reasons behind you need a WordPress maintenance plan. 1 Checklist Security to avoid being hacked Security is perhaps the major reason why you should keep your WordPress website up to date, above all other benefits. According to indusface, Every 39 seconds, a website is targeted, and attackers steal 75 records each second. This means your website is always on the verge of being hacked and you can lose your valuable data and critical information and which will hamper your business severely. According to Hosting Tribunal, WordPress currently powers 39.6% of all online websites in the world. And because of its popularity, WordPress websites always stay on top of hackers’ targets. As it is open-source, there is a possibility that hackers might study the source code and discover new ways to sneak into websites. Therefore, If your WordPress website is not kept up to date with the newest security updates, it becomes more insecure by the day. 2 Maximum Performance Benefits In this fast-paced world, everyone has become used to the fastest internet, for example, if you search “WordPress”, google will show you About 2,640,000,000 results within 0.51 seconds which is a lot of results in a very little time. If your website’s loading page becomes slow then it will surely affect your online presence negatively. According to BackLinko, a web page’s average page loading time is 10.3 seconds on desktop and 27.3 seconds on mobile.WordPress website needs many plug-ins and among them, if a single plug-in is missing an update then this can slow down your website. Developers should maintain regular updates to ensure compatibility. If you run your WordPress website maintenance regularly, you can easily ensure the fastest speed on your site which will maximize the website’s performance and help you to gain more traffic. 3 Create a Backup of your WordPress Website You may have installed security measures to protect your website, yet your website data may still be compromised. The possibility of hackers obtaining corporate data or an innocent coding error putting your site down will always exist. As a result, it is critical that your WordPress maintenance plan includes regular off-site backups. The term “off-site” refers to backing up your website on a second server, giving you two backup sources.f something were to happen to your website, you will be glad you invested in regular off-site backups and do not lose useful data. 4 Enhance your User Experience Without proper maintenance, your WordPress website may contain bugs that will lead to a poor user experience due to website errors such as broken forms, slow loading speed, images that disappear, and so on.Nobody loves a site that looks confused and broken or is out of date, and it might frustrate the visitors. Updating your WordPress website regularly and including a “bug repair” system can find out all little bugs and repair them to enhance the user experience for your website. You should always prioritize user experience as it plays a crucial role in your web development and maintenance service. 5 Keep Up with the New Technology Every day, the technology that interfaces with your WordPress website evolve. Aside from adopting frequent software updates to keep software versions as current as possible, it is also critical to keep an eye on the market for newer and better software in general.Eventually, a particular piece of technology may become outdated and no longer be as effective as it was before.With WordPress support and maintenance services, you can ensure that your website is always running to the highest industry standards by regularly updating WordPress themes, plug-ins, and versions. 6 Site Health Monitoring Crawlers for search engines filter through web pages in the backend and index them for visitors. Working links, backups, and optimizations are all signs of a healthy website. Incorrect backlinks, 404 error pages, and slow-loading pages can harm your website’s reputation. Regular health inspections by experienced personnel guarantee that adequate storage space is used, site speed is adequate, an",
