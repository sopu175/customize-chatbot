We have conducted strategic and technical meetings with the client about their vision for the brand. They wanted a completely individual, stand-out website, with innovative functionality and clean and elegant design.

The expertise and knowledge of the highly accomplished management with 22 years of extensive experience in the relevant area makes Aakash Development unique. The current undergoing projects located at major central points of Dhaka are architectural landmarks and serve as models for future high-rise construction and these buildings would effectively create new benchmarks for development and serve as baselines for sustainable performances of the real estate development sector in the largest urban region. The website would have to enable clients to better communicate with the brand and determine what they wanted to know about the company and its services. The look and feel of the site should represent the supreme sense of luxury of the brand's essence. To realistically reach the ultimate goal, the website had to be robust, sensitive, mobile-friendly, secure, as well as informative. Team Dcastalia thoroughly researched and conducted strategic workshops to meet the requirements of the company. We designed a fully-responsive landing page that incorporated Aakash development’s digital assets, creating an intuitive user experience with an improved flow.",

Their team of supremely skilled individuals have achieved their goals no matter the complexity of the situation, as is testified by their satisfied customers whose faith they have gained throughout the years. The website needed to be a reflection of the brand; impressive, sleek and luxurious. It also needed to mirror the brochure and link them both together, so each page within the site was designed to utilise the bespoke photography and relate back to the layout used within the brochure. We developed a bespoke design that incorporated the key deliverables to satisfy the requirements of the company. We are most proud of the smooth interactions we created and implemented across the website. They enabled us to increase the overall user experience.",

The organization prioritizes to provide better livelihood for unprivileged people, specifically for children. As part of their &ldquo;The South Asia Wash Results Programme (SAWRP)&rdquo;, they required a database system that would record and track sanitation and hygiene data collection from different parts of Bangladesh. The system would not only have to store information of the collected data but also the person conducting it. Additionally, the report that would be produced should have to reflect the impact of the surveys. ... We went through a comprehensive research on the existing procedure and developed a digitalized database application enabling central authority with real-time access to collected data. The overall objective of the project required elaborate tasks such as an access control system for authenticated users to log in and access information; recording the answers of the survey, and form a well organized report to be sent to the higher officials managing the programme.",

Then we set goals according to their requirements. Stage 2. Discussing the project goals with the team The next stage we discuss the project goals with our entire team. Each team then identifies their own goals whether it is designing phase, development phase or functionality. Stage 3. Creating design prototypes The design team starts preparing the prototype of the interfaces. Several sketches are made and after that a higher fidelity is established. From all of those designs, the best wireframe is selected and the development process starts at the next stage. Stage 4. Development of the application The development team works with the selected prototype in this stage and starts implementing each module of each function. If there are any design complications, those are also handled by the design team. After all the functions are developed (mentioned in the project goals list) a working prototype model of the application is launched for QA. Stage 5. QA and delivery Our QA team then initiates their quality check on each of the functionalities of the application. If there&#39;s a bug, it is reported in a list that directly goes to the development team and the team starts working on a fix. This loop continues until there are no more remaining bugs left in the system. Finally, the project is ready to be delivered. We still keep checking and updating the application making sure that it performs perfectly.",

Preparing the first sketch After we understand who the user of the system is, what they are going to be doing, and with what, we then prepare the first sketch to see how they will be using the product. Stage 4. Sketching a rudimentary structure After the user flow is complete, we get the best layout plans for the product. We then create sketches using sketch pads that have the correct aspect ratio grid lines for multiple devices. Stage 5. Designing low to high fidelity prototypes Creating the digital version of the sketches is the first step in formalizing them. The prototype becomes more practical and elements more structured, and the product begins to take shape.",

        "content": "Keyword research is a critical step and also very time-consuming. In this stage, we find the keyword phrases that will be used for optimization. When conducting keyword research we try to find the balance between two major factors which are, high keyword usage by people and comparatively low utilization in search engines by competitors. Understanding the starting position of the client site and Goal setting After we are done establishing the targeted keyword phrases of the client&#39;s site and starting position relative to the site&rsquo;s competitive set, we then try to understand the starting position of the client site is in the search engine. When we have this information, we can then see which areas require optimization and it also provides us with a baseline against which to gauge the subsequent campaign&rsquo;s success. Another aspect that we focus on is the traffic of the client site. This gives us the information on how many visitors are visiting the client&#39;s site, how are the visitors finding the site, what keywords are they using, bounce rate, etc. all this information helps us in making further marketing decisions. Implementing Content Strategy High-quality content and link building are the two most important signals used by Google to rank your website for search. When a site loads with high-quality content, it gives the visitor a reason to stay and also gives them a reason to revisit if the contents are really engaging. Visitors arrive at your website seeking information and if your content is successful in giving them the information they need then this increases the site&#39;s statistics. So, if you are able to deliver the exact thing the visitors want you to get a lot of benefits from the search engine. It increases your site&#39;s credibility and now you will rank higher in the search results. That is why we highly focus on quality content that is informative and also appealing to the visitors. Conducting Onsite optimization It is a good idea to have your page title something catchier than just a flat &ldquo;welcome&rdquo;. Ideally, we try to use the targeted phrase for that page and then follow with the company name. On the completion of keyword research, we try to place the words in the right place. A keyword placed in the title or heading is more effective than burying it halfway down the paragraph. Also, by using large font sizes and bold texts can highlight its importance and positively affect the page&rsquo;s ranking for that phrase. We develop a site map that includes a well-organized list of links to all the important pages of the website. We also include a text link to the site map on the home page. When the bot of the search engine visits the page, it will be easier for it to index the website. The alt tag is used to describe an image. This field can be left blank but for SEO purposes it is highly recommended to use alt tags. Meta tags are included in the top positions of the HTML and it is used to describe relevant information of the website to the search engine. This is very important as sometimes the description from your meta tag is a way in which the search engine pulls out your website on search results. There are a number of important technical issues that impact SEO efforts that need to be verified and corrected if needed. These include site speed, site security, and mobile responsiveness. Offsite SEO and Branding The number of social media users is very high in fact there are 3.5 billion social media users worldwide. We help clients to build up social media posts and pages in order to increase traffic to the website. In this way more and more organic traffic increases which elevate the website&rsquo;s statistics. If there are multiple quality links to your website then it increases the likelihood of both the search engine bots crawling through your website as well as visitors visiting your page for a particular service. Google views the links to your websites as votes and rewards those sites accordingly as long as those links are of high quality. We use tools like Google&rsquo;s Search Console that provides information regarding the inbound links to your website. Based on the different analytical reports, we compare your site rankings, traffic, social signals, and other key metrics to optimize and generate measurable results. We keep conducting this process on a regular interval. The specific metrics used in an SEO plan will depend on the goals of that site.",

Alignment with respective organizational goals The training program that we arrange offers knowledge depending on the organization&rsquo;s goals. We evaluate the business outcomes and decide what skills are needed to achieve those outcomes.&nbsp; Stage 3. Appointing manager to improve learning efficiency In order to increase employee engagement in learning, we directly involve the managers as they specifically know which part of the skills need improvement. Stage 4. Encouraging individual solutions to problem statements to increase creativity At this stage, we encourage employees to offer their own solutions to the problems to make them more involved, allow them to explore more creative possibilities and thus making the business more efficient.&nbsp; Stage 5. Application of post-training activities to increase adaptability A good idea of effective training is to conduct post-training follow-ups as short lessons to review new concepts and face to face discussions which ensures a better understanding of new concepts and that they are practised.",

Conceptualization - Firstly, we discuss with our client and try to know more about their business process to understand which model out of many customized ones will be more suited for the client’s needs. Delegation - After talking to our client, identify the project goals and it gets distributed to each member of the team whether it is the designing phase, development phase, or functionality with robust teamwork of testing, security, or other team members. Prototyping - At this stage, our user experience designers prepare a non-functional model which helps us to see the entire solution visually. This is either sketched out or graphically created. Collaboration - When the interface is created, our development team with the client’s feedback, starts working on the system. Delivery - In this phase, the development team fully focuses on the system and implements the functionalities with a method of Agile and in some cases with Waterfall. QA &amp; Integration - In the QA line our team checks each and every function of the working model for bugs and issues. After the issues are resolved, we deliver the project to our client.",

Conceptualization - Firstly, we discuss with our client and try to know more about their business process to understand which model out of many customized ones will be more suited for the client’s needs. Delegation - After talking to our client, identify the project goals and it gets distributed to each member of the team whether it is the designing phase, development phase, or functionality with robust team work of testing, security, or other team members. Prototyping - At this stage, our user experience designers prepare a non-functional model which helps us to see the entire solution visually. This is either sketched out or graphically created. Collaboration - When the interface is created, our development team with the client’s feedback, starts working on the system. Delivery - In this phase, the development team fully focuses on the system and implements the functionalities with a method of Agile and in some cases with Waterfall. QA &amp; Integration - In the QA line our team checks each and every function of the working model for bugs and issues. After the issues are resolved, we deliver the project to our client.",
